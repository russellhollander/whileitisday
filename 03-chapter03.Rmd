# Workers Together with Him!  2 Cor. 6, 1
## The Biblical Precept and Example. {-}

It is a wonderful name:  "WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD!" -- a name of rich content, a name which bestows a world of honor upon us.

The very expression "together with us" is full of significance and power.  It reminds us of so many other gifts and blessings of God, especially of those which were so richly imparted to us in Christ Jesus.

We are _heirs together with Christ_, as St. Paul so beautifully states: --

"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and _joint heirs with Christ_."  Rom. 8, 16. 17.

And it is particularly comforting to us, who are descendants of heathen, that St. Paul writes: -- 

"That the gentiles should be fellow-heirs and of the same body and partakers of His promise in Christ by the Gospel."  Eph. 3, 6.

We are _partakers together of the life in Christ_, which will have its culmination in the enjoyment of the glory of heaven.  The apostle states: --

"It is a faithful saying:  For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him."  2 Tim. 2, 11. 12.

The honor which has thereby been bestowed on the human race can hardly be estimated highly enough, for it is one point of evidence showing the greatness of God's mercy toward us.

The very inspired writers marvel at some of the facts connected with the history of man's redemption.  In the mystery of the incarnation, for instance, one might well wonder why the Lord did not appear in the form of an angel to bring redemption to men.  But we are told: -- 

"Verily He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham."  Heb. 2, 16.

Well may we sing in the glorious Christmastide:

| 	Th' eternal Father's only son
| 	For a manger leaves His throne;
| 	Disguised in our poor flesh and blood
| 	Is now the everlasting Good.

The mystery of the incarnation of our Lord, as the first step in the perfected redemption, is so great that the "angels desire to look into" the marvelous facts connected therewith.  1 Pet. 1, 12.

It is true, moreover, that the Lord uses the holy angels as His messengers.  Thus we find that the angel Gabriel was at various times sent to Daniel, particularly to strengthen and comfort him on account of the visions which were given to him.  The same angel was sent also to Mary and to Zacharias.

But angels are not honored with the name of WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD.  While an angel brought the news of the birth of the Savior to the shepherds on the fields of Bethlehem, and while it was a chorus of angels that first sang an anthem of praise in glorifying God for this holy birth, it is true, nevertheless, that angels were not entrusted with the divine commission, but this _distinction was given to human beings_.

NOT ANGELS, BUT MEN are chosen by God to preach the Gospel to every creature; upon MEN is placed the obligation of love.  Those whose brother the Savior became by His sacred incarnation are to make known to all members of the human family the news of the redemption wrought by their Brother.

With the consciousness of this distinction, of this unequaled honor, we can understand the precepts of the Lord.  For it is not only in the divine commission itself that He speaks to us concerning the need of bringing the message of salvation to others, but also in many other passages, whose import and significance should be considered by us with the most assiduous attention.

Even in the Old Testament we find the Lord calling out to us in an excess of jubilation: -- 

"Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved.  He shall judge the people righteously."  Ps. 96, 10.

And we may well consider, in this connection, passages like Ps. 117, 1; Is. 34, 1; Jer. 4, 2.

But it is in the New Testament that this feature of bringing to others the assurance of the redemption gained by Christ is particularly prominent.  Who could forget the words addressed by Christ to the healed and grateful demoniac: -- 

"Return to thine own house and show how great things God hath done unto thee"?  Luke 8, 39.

In this case it required no second urging, for we are told that "he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."

Can we afford to do less with the fulness of God's spiritual blessings resting upon us?

The words of St. Paul to the Galatians are well known, but they will bear repetition: -- 

"Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."  Gal. 6, 9. 10.

Can we pass on greater blessings than the forgiveness of sins, peace with God, the happiness of a good conscience, which are ours in the Gospel?  

What more impressive precept than that contained in the words of the great apostle and missionary in Col. 1, 26-29?

"Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to His saints:  to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; whereunto I also labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily."

Words of the greatest humility, surely, that Paul is also trying to do his share.  And shall we not strive to follow the precept contained in this declaration with regard to making known to others the riches of the glory of this mystery?

Consider for a moment the place that soul-winning occupied in the apostolic mind.  The early Church proved itself in every way a soul-winning organization.  We are told that on Pentecost Day those who gladly received the words of Peter were baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  Acts 2, 41.  Again we read that many of them which heard the Word believed; and the number of men was about five thousand.  Acts 4, 4.  Once more we are told that believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.  Acts 5, 14.  And again, that the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly.  Acts 6, 7.  Compare Acts 12, 24; 19, 18. 20.

Can we ever forget that Saul, just as soon as he himself was brought to the knowledge of the truth, set about winning others, and that the passion for souls never left him?  How remarkably well the purpose of his life is set forth in his words to the Romans: -- 

"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved!"  Chap 10, 1.

But there is still more to be considered in trying to realize the full significance of being WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD.  

The example of those who were, in the special sense of the word, ministers of God, who were in charge of the public proclamation of the Word, stands out on practically every page of Holy Writ.  Even in the Old Testament we find Moses pleading with Hobab, his brother-in-law: -- 

"Come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel....And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will he do unto thee."  Num. 10, 29. 32.

In a much higher degree and to a much greater extent we find this spirit in the spiritual leaders of the New Testament, not only in St. Paul, but in Peter and the other apostles as well.  They all regarded their own lives as being of little account if they might but win souls for Christ.  Publicly and from house to house they made known the message of salvation that by all means some might be saved.

But a fact which is still more interesting and significant in the present study is that which concerns

\begin{center} THE WORK OF LAYMEN IN THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH \end{center}

This fact is brought to our attention from a number of angles, both by express statements and by deductions which may rightly be made from the narrative.

Have you ever stopped to consider how many congregations were founded by laymen in the years between 30 and 60 A.D.?

We are familiar with the fact that Stephen was the first Christian martyr.  Now it is a remarkable testimony to the manner in which God carries on the work of His kingdom that the persecution which followed the assassination of Stephen was an instrument in the hands of Providence to spread the Gospel.

"And they were scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles....  They that were scattered abroad went everywhere, preaching the Word."  Acts 8, 1. 4.

Mind you, it is expressly stated that the apostles were not included in this scattering.  For the present they stayed in Jerusalem.  It was the lay members that spread the Gospel through Western Judea and Samaria.  The apostles received information that churches had been established in Samaria, and only then did they send Peter and John to establish these congregations by giving them a regular ministry.  Acts 8, 14.

At Damascus likewise Christians were found, and evidently in some numbers; for Saul went there with the avowed intention of bringing men and women bound to Jerusalem.  Acts 9, 2. 14.

Western Judea had been so thoroughly evangelized by Christians from Jerusalem, Acts 8, 1, that there were saints, believers, members of the Church at Lydda, at Saron, and at Joppa.  Acts 9, 32. 35. 36.  

Of special interest in this connection is the account which we find of the founding of churches in Syria, because Antioch later became a great center of Christianity.  We are told: -- 

"Now, they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the Word to none but unto the Jews only.  And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus."  Acts 11, 19. 20.

We have here, then, the first account of an open attempt to bring the Gospel to such as were not Jews, to people of an entirely different race and nation.  This attempt was made by men from the island of Cyprus and from the region of Cyrene in Egypt.  These men, as members of the Jewish Dispersion, were more favorably inclined toward those speaking a different language.  It was not a liberal attitude, but a fine zeal for the spread of the Gospel which actuated them.

The reference to Phenicia at this point explains another fact which is brought to our attention somewhat later.  In Acts 21, 3. 4 we find that there were disciples at Tyre, and not only men, but also women and children, and in verse 7 we read of brethren at Ptolemais, another Phenician port.  These congregations evidently belonged to the group of those that have been founded in the early thirties, when the persecution following the death of Stephen took place.

But the most interesting story is that of the congregation at Rome.  We have no historical account of the founding of this church, and it was already in existence for some time when Paul wrote his epistle, early in the year 57.  The obvious conclusion is this, that some of the strangers from Rome, Acts 2, 10, returned to the capital city of the empire and testified for the truth of the Gospel.  At first the congregation was strongly Jewish in character, but in the course of time Gentiles were added, until they formed the majority.  It is quite certain that no other apostle had been in Rome at the time when Paul sent his letter, Rom. 15, 20; for his entire letter is an exposition of the fundamentals of Christian doctrine.  The congregation at Rome, founded by laymen at an early date, had maintained itself for more than two decades, being fortunate in having experienced Christians from other parts of the empire visiting them from time to time and strengthening them in their work.  So well had the Christians of Rome been established by the early sixties that the decree of Claudius banishing all Jews from Rome had not permanently injured the congregation; for after the death of Claudius the work had rapidly been reestablished and stations founded even in the suburbs, as at Puteoli.  Acts 28, 13. 14.

To these interesting and fascinating facts much other information could be added, but we must here add at least one further section, namely, that concerning individual, personal work; for such it is that every Christian is in a position to do.

It is here that we are amazed at the array of facts bringing home to us the BLESSEDNESS OF PERSONAL WORK.  

Who will, at this point, not immediately think of the shepherds at Bethlehem, who immediately "made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this Child?"?  Luke 2, 17.  We think also of Anna, the prophetess, who "spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."  Luke 2, 38.  

We cannot omit a reference to the first five disciples of the Lord, two of whom at once became missionaries and informed others of their happiness in having found the Messiah.  John 1, 41. 45.  Almost pathetic is the case of the Samaritan woman, who ran to the city with her eager announcement: -- 

"Come, see a man which told me all things which ever I did:  is not this the Christ?"  John 4, 29.

These are all cases of testifying for Christ and thus spreading the Gospel of salvation by direct personal contact.  But we have records of even more work done by the early Christians, and that by lay members.

A most outstanding example is that of AQUILA and PRISCILLA.

Our first information concerning this consecrated Christian and his equally consecrated wife is given us in connection with the decree of Claudius commanding the Jews to depart from Rome.  This was in the year 49 A.D.  They came to Corinth and established themselves there.  The next year the Apostle Paul, coming over from Athens, worked in the shop which they had established, the craft being that of tent-making.  When Paul left the city after about twenty months, these two consecrated Christians accompanied him as far as Ephesus, where they remained when he found it necessary to hurry away to Jerusalem.  In the interval of his absence they did fine work in establishing the congregation in Ephesus and in making known to Apollos the full counsel of God, as we read in Acts 18.  When Paul came down to Ephesus about two years later, fine progress had been made.  Aquila and Priscilla opened their home to the congregation as a meeting place, as Paul notes with grateful appreciation.  1. Cor. 16, 19.

In the year 54 A.D. Claudius Caesar died, and so, the decree banishing the Jews from the capital city was no longer in force.  Accordingly, Aquila and Priscilla returned to Rome, evidently to take care of their business interests.  But they were just as active in church-work here as they had been in Corinth and in Ephesus; for we find that Paul, writing from Corinth in 57, sends greetings to the church that is in their house.  Rom. 16, 5.  Some nine or ten years later, however, we find them living once more in Ephesus, for St. Paul, writing to Timothy in that city, sends greetings to "Prisca and Aquila."  2 Tim. 4, 19.

What a wonderful career is here sketched for us:  consecrated lay people serving the great apostle in various ways, as he indicates Rom. 16, 3-5, giving diligence to the instruction of Apollos, harboring the congregation in their house!  

Nor were they the only Christians whose labors for the Lord are acknowledged by Paul.  If we but read the list of names in Romans 16 and note what he has to say with regard to the several people mentioned there; if we glance at the first verses in Philippians 4; if we consider, for a moment, the names of Luke, of Aristarchus, of Tychicus, and others, of Gaius, concerning whom St. John writes that his charitable endeavors are very acceptable indeed, 3 John 5-8, -- we are surprised in a manner which causes us to emulate their example.

Truly, we can be

\begin{center} WORKERS TOGETHER WITH HIM, \end{center}

if we but follow the Biblical precept and example.
