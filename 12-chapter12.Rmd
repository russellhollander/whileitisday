# Feed My Lambs!  John 21, 15
## Founding and Conducting a Sunday-School. {-}

The subject of this chapter is very closely connected with that of all personal endeavor in mission work.  It links up with the historical fact that the laymen of the early Church were actively engaged in spreading the Gospel, as we learned in Chapter 3, and that the Lord expects all Christians, whether pastors or laymen, to take a direct, personal, active interest in the spread of His kingdom.

The matter is brought home to us even by a consideration of some historical facts in church history.  The Methodist Church did not come into existence until a century after the establishment of the first Lutheran congregation in America.  And yet, this denomination has more than twice as many members in our country as all Lutheran bodies put together.  The Baptists began work in our country in 1636, or about the same time that Lutheran preaching was established on the Delaware.  Yet the Baptists, too, are much stronger than the combined Lutheran bodies of our country.
