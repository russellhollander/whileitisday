# Patient Toward All Men.  1 Thess. 5, 14.
## Meeting Objections of the Wrongly Informed. {-}

As WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD much of our work will naturally concern the unchurched; in fact, this is the only part of our work in which we can be aggressive, in which we can and should take the initiative.

Lutheran soul-winners are not proselyters.  In all our work we follow the admonition of the apostle:

"LET NONE of you suffer...as a BUSY-BODY in other men's matters."  1 Pet. 4, 15.

We find that the Apostolic Church was ever most careful in avoiding the offense, according to which men break int othe herd of another and steal his sheep.  The transgression is commonly known as "sheep-stealing" and is rightly detested by all such as uphold the dignity of the Church and the rights of the Lord's servants.  The demand of the Lord is simply this, that we should not take the initiative in getting people to join our church who are members of any Christian denomination, not only of another congregation of our own church, but of any church of which we have evidence that it is still rightly designated as a Christian church.  This means, generally speaking, acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God, believ in the Triune God of Scriptures and in Jesus Christ as the only Redeemer of mankind, and the use of the means of grace in public worship.  In this sense we regard all the Reformed bodies (Presbyterians, Eposcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, Christian Reformed, etc), with the exception of the Campbellites, as well as the Catholics, as Christian bodies.  But we do not so regard the Unitarians, the Universalists, the Mormons, the Christian Scientists, the Spiritualists, and many other bodies of the same kind, for all of these deny the Trinity of the Bible.

With regard to members of non-Christian bodies the same rules are observed as apply to the unchurched.  With regard to such as are members of a body which causes us to regard it as Christian we follow the rule of Holy Writ which states that we are not to interfere, not to take the initiative in getting their members to join our Church.  It is most fortunate, as one Church Father puts it, that "the ears of the hearers in such denominations are often purer than the lips of their teachers"; that is, by the grace of God and the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, many false statements made by their teachers are stripped of their falseness in being transmitted to the hearers, or many of the latter rely upon the Word which they study at home and promptly forget the incorrect teaching which was brought to them in their own church.

At the same time we welcome such people if they, of their own initiative, come to our services or approach us in their search for the full truth.  Since, by the grace of God, we are in possession of the full truth in Christian doctrine, we are UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF LOVE to impart this bleassing to all who seek it.  That is the object of all our advertising, to call the attention of men to the saving truth which we possess and which should by us be made known to others.  Even if such people are, at first, only visitors at our services, we bid them a cordial welcome, asking them to judge for themselves whether we teach the full truth of the Bible or not.  Of the people of Berea it is stated with approval: --

"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily _whether those things were so_."  Acts 17, 11.

We take the same attitude with regard to those who approach us privately or who broach the subject of religion and of Christian doctrine in a conversation anywhere.  This gives us an opportunity to testify for the truth, and our testimony may prove the entering-wedge for the Gospel-message in all its purity.  

The Apostle Paul indicates to us in what spirit the work with the wrongly informed should be carried on.

"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded [faint-hearted], support the weak, BE PATIENT TOWARD ALL MEN!"  1 Thess. 5, 14.

The spirit of Paul was the spirit of Christ.  Jesus also hated sin, but loved the sinner, not with a weak sentimentality, but with an unspeakable yearning for the salvation of his soul.  And therefore we, too, must let the same mind dwell in us.  While we are impatient for the glory of the Lord and jealous for the full truth of the Bible, we are PATIENT WITH THE WEAKNESS AND THE DULNESS of men in spiritual matters.

We have the background of hundreds of years of sound Gospel-preaching; we have the background of a thorough indoctrination, preferably in the Christian day-school; we have the background of church customs which are hallowed by centuries of use and have a significance which has endeared them to us.  

But now people come to us who are wrongly informed concerning many of these facts.  Others begin to argue with us on the basis of a false prejudice.  And very contradictory statements indeed are those that come to our attention.  One says:  "Why, you Lutherans are just like the Catholics; you have altars in your churches, and you use the cross in your services."  Others say:  "You Lutherans are just like the Presbyterians, or like the Methodists -- you are so strict with regard to worldly amusements."  The number of objections which have been voiced might be continued almost indefinitely.

A Lutheran SOUL-WINNER ought to be in a position to meet such objections; for it is not at all difficult so to do, especially if one uses a little common sense.
