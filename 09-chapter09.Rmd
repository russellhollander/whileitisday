# Patient Toward All Men.  1 Thess. 5, 14.
## Meeting Objections of the Wrongly Informed. {-}

As WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD much of our work will naturally concern the unchurched; in fact, this is the only part of our work in which we can be aggressive, in which we can and should take the initiative.

Lutheran soul-winners are not proselyters.  In all our work we follow the admonition of the apostle:

"LET NONE of you suffer...as a BUSY-BODY in other men's matters."  1 Pet. 4, 15.
