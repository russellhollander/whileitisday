# The Time is Short.  1 Cor. 7, 29
## Salesmanship for the Lord. {-}

The qualifications which we considered in the last chapter make for a strong Christian personality.  The possession of any one of them or of a group of them is a fine asset to the soul-winner.  But he must not be satisfied with having gained some measure of ability along one line.  It is necessary for him to build up for higher efficiency.  Let us group some of the positive qualities which come into consideration in working for the Lord.

Let us list some of the qualifications of the intellect, of the sensibilities, of the will, and of the spirit, or heart, as they must be highly developed and as they must be kept in the highest possible state of efficiency.

But he must not be satisfied with having gained some measure ofa bility along one line.  It is necessary for him to build up for higher efficiency.  Let us group some of the positive qualities which come into consideration in working for the Lord.

Let us list some of the qualifications of the intellect, of the sensibilities, of the will, and of the spirit, or heart, as they must be highly developed and as they must be kept in the highest possible state of efficiency.

1.  The qualities which are important for _ability_:
	- Observation
	- Concentration
	- Memory
	- Imagination
	- Judgment
	- Reason

2.  The qualities which ensure _reliability_: 
	- Honesty
	- Loyalty
	- Sincerity
	- Ambition
	- Enthusiasm
	- Optimism

3.  The qualities which are essential for _leadership_:
	- Decision
	- Punctuality
	- Courage
	- Initiative

4.  The spiritual qualities which are _required in the soul-winner_:  
	- Eagerness for growth in knowledge
	- Faith
	- Love
	- Hope

Observation is needed to see and develop opportunities and to read the character of people.  Concentration enables one to give the peroper attention to a problem.  Memory ought to be developed for the sake of remembering facts needed in soul-winning efforts.  The imagination must be duly cultivated for the sake of planning campaigns and presenting possibilities.  The judgment ought to be so developed that all ordinary arguments may be both employed and answered.  Reason must be made the handmaid of all our work in the Church.

Honestly will often do more to convince people than arguments in themselves.  Loyalty and faithfulness, together with close application, will create an atmosphere of conviction.  Ambition in the interest of the Lord and His work will tend to bring about an attitude of eagerness to build the kingdom of the Lord.  This will be further aided by enthusiasm and a proper optimism based on the Lord's promises.

If one cultivates the quality of quick and correct decision, he will be dependable in positions of leadership.  Punctuality in all undertakings, in keeping all appointments, enables one to grasp a situation according to its general outlines before others have so much as arrived.  Courage enables one to undertake even a difficult task with a determination which is half the battle.  Initiative finds an opening and takes hold of problems without hesitation.

These qualities must and should be used in SALESMANSHIP FOR THE LORD.

This is necessary because THE TIME IS SHORT.  1 Cor. 7, 29.

"The end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer."  1 Pet. 4, 7.

"Little children, it is the las time."  1 John 2, 18.

"I must work the works of Him that sent Me while it is day; THE NIGHT COMETH WHEN NO MAN CAN WORK."  John 9, 4.

When a sales manager plans and maps out a campaign and finds that the time for carrying out his objectives is short, he will be all the more careful about instructing his salesmen along the lines of best endeavor.  He will try to communicate to every one of them the mental alertness, the eager tension with which he is himself imbued.  Every movement must count; he cannot afford one moment of lost motion.

Even so, in these last days of the world, every Christian, a soul-winner by virtue of his profession, will strain every nerve to gain souls for the salvation prepared for them in Christ Jesus.

Since we are here chiefly concerned with personal work, we note, first of all, that the soul-winner must _study the individual_ with whom he is dealing.  It is a question of observing faces intently, of determining, by the expression of eyes and features, whether a contact has been, or is being, establishes.  A pleasant and cheerful voice is much more likely to attract than one which grates on the prosect's ear.  The message which we have is to be brought with clearness, force, and elegance.  Clearness appeals to the intellect; force appeals to the emotions; elegance appeals to the taste.  The more we know human nature and the better we are able to analyze the emotions, the better we shall be able to influence them in a manner which will pave the way for a willing acceptance of our invitation for Christ.

We are salesmen for Christ; we are engaged in bringing the blessings of salvation to men who are in need of them; we have orders to call the attention of men everywhere to the wonderful call of the Lord:

"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money:  come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price!"  Is. 55, 1.

With this wonderful obligation and responsibility resting upon us, we ought to be familiar with the _seven mental processes_ through which the mind of the missionary prospect must be taken before we can expect him to be interested in the great message of salvation.

First:  He must be met; we must somehow get together with him.

Secondly:  His attention must be attracted to the message which we have for him, and that in such a manner that a favorable mental impression is immediately created in the prospect's mind.

Thirdly:  We must arouse the prospect's interest.

Fourthly:  We must convince him that our proposition is to his advantage.  

Fifthly:  We must cause him, if possible, to have a desire for our message and its contents.

Sixthly:  We must, if possible, add to this desire a positive resolve on the part of the prospect to possess the blessing of which we are speaking.

Seventhly:  We must bring about favorable action on the part of the prospect.
