# The Time is Short.  1 Cor. 7, 29
## Salesmanship for the Lord. {-}

The qualifications which we considered in the last chapter make for a strong Christian personality.  The possession of any one of them or of a group of them is a fine asset to the soul-winner.  But he must not be satisfied with having gained some measure of ability along one line.  It is necessary for him to build up for higher efficiency.  Let us group some of the positive qualities which come into consideration in working for the Lord.

Let us list some of the qualifications of the intellect, of the sensibilities, of the will, and of the spirit, or heart, as they must be highly developed and as they must be kept in the highest possible state of efficiency.
