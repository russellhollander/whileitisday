LET US NOT BE WEARY!

The work of th epersonal mission-canvass is not easy.  It often requires all the believer's physical and spiritual stamina.  The great majority of people in the world are not interested in the message of salvation.  The number of cheerful greetings on the part of those visited will be comparatively few.  It does happen, of course, that people are frankly delighted to have us call and show a personal interest in them.  That is when the canvasser feels the rich blessing which attends the soul-winner.  

On the whole, it may be said that the systematic canvass has certain elements that make it attractive. There is the combination of talents and energy; there is the stimulation of the contact with kindred minds bent upon the accomplishment of a great object; there is the exhiliration of the work itself; for there is always the possibility of finding souls that hunger and thirst after righteousness.

It is different, on the whole, with FOLLOW-UP WORK.  There the preliminary report has been made, the possiblity of new and encouraging discoveries is fairly remote.  Follow-up work means to use endless kindness and tact and patience in keeping alive the spark of interest and in kindling it into a warm and bright flame.  It means, in some cases, losing people who seemed to be fairly good prospects because they, after all, prefer the ways of the world to the ways of the Church.  It means finding oneself in the spiritual condition of Elijah when he cried out in the bitterness of his heart: --

"It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers... The children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left."  1 Kings 19, 4. 10.  

For this reason the words of the holy apostle are so wonderful for the soul-winner at this stage: --

"LET US NOT BE WEARY IN WELL-DOING; for in due season we shall reap, IF WE FAINT NOT.  _As we have therefore opportunity_, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."  Gal. 6, 9. 10.

In this we ought to be strengthened particularly by a consideration of the mercy of God in His follow-up work for men.  There are the countless evidences of His love and grace in dealing with entire nations.  With what unspeakably wonderful kindness and patience did He deal with His chosen people in the Old Testament!  As often as they provoked Him to anger with their murmuring and with their idolatry, He nevertheless turned to them in mercy whenever they repented and cried to Him for help.  

"The Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants, the prophets."  2 Kings 17, 13.

Even when the Lord was finally provoked to such depths of anger as to have Israel removed from the Land of Promise, He caused the more serious people in its midst to cast their lot with Judah; and even when Judah was led astray into captivity, He promised deliverance and return to those who would seek His face.  And let us not forget that from the remnant of the covenant people who returned to the land of their fathers the Lord chose a maiden to be mother of the Redeemer, and Christ's first personal followers, the nucleus of the New Testament Church, were people who were descendants of Abraham according to the flesh.

Of such a nature is the Lord's FOLLOW-UP WORK!

And he shows the same patient love in dealing with individuals.  Where would David have been if the Lord had not sought him again and again when he sinned?  What would have become of Peter if there had been no room for repentance after his denial of his Savior?

We have but to examine our own lives to realize, in a measure, the patience of God in dealing with us poor sinners.  As often as we have provoked Him, not only with small transgressions, but with great and deliberate sins, and that time and again, He has been ready to forgive and to forget and to pour out on us once more the fulness of His mercy in Christ Jesus.

That is true FOLLOW-UP WORK, such as we are to learn from the Lord!

In order to do real follow-up work, then, it is necessary for the worker to intensify whatever previous impressions of soul-winning he has gained.  He must dwell, time and again, on the _example of Scripture_, which must cause us to bring the invitation of Philip with patient repetition: --

"COME AND SEE" John 1, 46.

No matter what objections are brought by those whom we are trying to win for Christ, and no matter how often we have confessed our belief in the Bible and all its doctrines, the final call which we must issue to all men everywhere is to COME AND SEE.  Let them but examine our Confessions, let them but hear our sermons, let them but search the Scriptures, -- that is what we ask, knowing that the Holy Spirit, working through the Word, will kindle faith where and when He will.
