LET US NOT BE WEARY!

The work of th epersonal mission-canvass is not easy.  It often requires all the believer's physical and spiritual stamina.  The great majority of people in the world are not interested in the message of salvation.  The number of cheerful greetings on the part of those visited will be comparatively few.  It does happen, of course, that people are frankly delighted to have us call and show a personal interest in them.  That is when the canvasser feels the rich blessing which attends the soul-winner.  

On the whole, it may be said that the systematic canvass has certain elements that make it attractive. There is the combination of talents and energy; there is the stimulation of the contact with kindred minds bent upon the accomplishment of a great object; there is the exhiliration of the work itself; for there is always the possibility of finding souls that hunger and thirst after righteousness.

It is different, on the whole, with FOLLOW-UP WORK.  There the preliminary report has been made, the possiblity of new and encouraging discoveries is fairly remote.  Follow-up work means to use endless kindness and tact and patience in keeping alive the spark of interest and in kindling it into a warm and bright flame.  It means, in some cases, losing people who seemed to be fairly good prospects because they, after all, prefer the ways of the world to the ways of the Church.  It means finding oneself in the spiritual condition of Elijah when he cried out in the bitterness of his heart: --

"It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers... The children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left."  1 Kings 19, 4. 10.  

For this reason the words of the holy apostle are so wonderful for the soul-winner at this stage: --

"LET US NOT BE WEARY IN WELL-DOING; for in due season we shall reap, IF WE FAINT NOT.  _As we have therefore opportunity_, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."  Gal. 6, 9. 10.

In this we ought to be strengthened particularly by a consideration of the mercy of God in His follow-up work for men.  There are the countless evidences of His love and grace in dealing with entire nations.  With what unspeakably wonderful kindness and patience did He deal with His chosen people in the Old Testament!  As often as they provoked Him to anger with their murmuring and with their idolatry, He nevertheless turned to them in mercy whenever they repented and cried to Him for help.  

"The Lord testified against Israel and against Judah by all the prophets and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants, the prophets."  2 Kings 17, 13.
