# Zealously Affected in a Good Thing!  Gal. 4, 18
## Qualifications of the Workers. {-}

The Scripture-passage which we have at the head of the present chapter is peculiarly appropriate to our discussion.  The Apostle Paul was not in sympathy with an attitude which is always ready to receive, the plea being that faith must be disassociated from works.  It is true that saving faith in its essence is the receiving of the grace of God in the Gospel.

But saving faith is, nevertheless, a living faith.  It is a light which not only receives fuel, but wich also shines.  The apostle fittingly calls it "faith _which worketh by love_," Gal. 5, 6, that is, a faith which is active in love, which shows itself in works of love.

It is here that we apply the admonition of St. Paul.  He was decidedly impatient with the false teachers among the Galatians, who were trying to lead the believers back into the bondage of the Law, to keep its precepts for the purpose of attaining to a righteousness of works and thus setting aside the righteousness of Christ, the righteousness which comes to men by faith in His vicarious atonement.  For that reason the apostle denounced the false teachers in no uncertain terms, telling the Christians that the interlopers were zealously affecting them, but not well; they were trying to stir them up to a frenzy of work-righteousness, but not in a manner which would really redound to the Christians' highest good.

Over against this wrong position the apostle places the correct principle, that of the Christians' growth in sanctification.  He writes: --

\begin{center} "IT IS GOOD TO BE ZEALOUSLY AFFECTED ALWAYS IN A GOOD THING!" \end{center}

Paul wanted the Galatian Christians to have the proper attitude of affection toward their Lord and Savior at all times, whether he were present or not.  This attitude would result in a zeal for Christ and His kingdom, which would show itself at all times.

There is no finer maxim than the above for the soul-winner, in whom the passion for souls is an every-day matter, who is ever on the lookout for opportunities to be more active in the Lord's service, to fit himself better for the privileges of the church-member, FOR THE WINNING OF SOULS!  

It is these qualifications which concern us in this chapter.  Not as though they would have to be our full possession before we may being on our task, but that they are placed before us as ideals after which we may strive all our life.  

The fundamental principle, as indicated above, is that of a _faith active in love_.  This faith is not a mere reliance on the ability of Christ as an inspiring leader nor a mere appreciation of His greatness as teacher, as so many Modernists sanctimoniously love to picture it, but it is the acceptance of Jesus Christ as one's personal Savior, who by his vicarious redemption has freed us from the guilt and the punishment of sin.  By virtue of this faith, men are justified in the sight of God, they are declared to be righteous, the perfect righteousness of Christ being imputed to them.
