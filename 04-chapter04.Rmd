# Zealously Affected in a Good Thing!  Gal. 4, 18
## Qualifications of the Workers. {-}

The Scripture-passage which we have at the head of the present chapter is peculiarly appropriate to our discussion.  The Apostle Paul was not in sympathy with an attitude which is always ready to receive, the plea being that faith must be disassociated from works.  It is true that saving faith in its essence is the receiving of the grace of God in the Gospel.

But saving faith is, nevertheless, a living faith.  It is a light which not only receives fuel, but wich also shines.  The apostle fittingly calls it "faith _which worketh by love_," Gal. 5, 6, that is, a faith which is active in love, which shows itself in works of love.
