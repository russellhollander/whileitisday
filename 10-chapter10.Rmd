# I Will Seek That Which was Lost.  Ezek. 34, 16.
## Canvassing. {-}

We have now come to the point where the practical execution of the plan is the primary consideration.  It is understood, of course, that the Lutheran soul-winner does not confine his efforts to any one day in the year, that he is not satisfied with one particular occasion for doing the greatest good.  Our aim is to do good to all men, to try to interest them in their soul's salvation at all times, to keep the possibilities of the message of redemption in view whenever occasion offers

At the same time, experience has shown that great, united, systematic mission endeavors are productive of much good.  It is self-evident, in the case of Lutherans, that the emotional element must not become too prominent.  Informatino concerning mission-work, concerning the will of God pertaining to our sanctification, a thorough knowledge of the needs of men and of the way to help them in their spiritual need is essential to our work.  Emotionalism alone is like a straw-fire, which quickly burns out and therefore is without lasting effects.  The fire which we aim to kindle by our missionary endeavors is intended to set fire to heart and conscience, to mind and soul, for we want men to accept the message of the recemption of their souls through the atonement wrought by Christ.

"I will make My words in thy mouth fire."  Jer. 5, 14.

"Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart."  Jer. 15, 16.

"O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord!"  Jer. 22, 29.

"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread or thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord."  Amos 8, 11.

"The Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."  Heb. 4, 12.

The fundamental idea, the thought underlying the whole project and giving it the proper motivation, is that indicated by the love of the Messiah.

"I WILL SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST!"  Ezek. 34, 16.

That was the definite intention, the consecrated determination, of the promised Messiah, of the Christ of God, hundreds of years before He appeared in the flesh.  It was not due to any fault on His part that men were lost.  Every member of mankind had but himself to blame for losing his way and being in danger of damnation.  All we like sheep have gone astray. -- But the Savior declared that He would SEEK that which was lost.  Without any merit or worthiness of the part of those who were concerned in His counsel of love He yet decided to make the sacrifice, to offer up Himself for the salvation of the human race.

LET THIS MIND BE ALSO IN US!  With this love of Christ stirring our hearts into a flame, with the full knowledge of the great issues involved, we must, in our canvassing, SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST.  Let that object stand out before our eyes at all times, and we shall not waver in our purpose.

The suggestion is to set our great endeavor in motion with a concerted effort and with the consciousness that hundreds and thousands of our fellow-Christians throughout the Church are similarly engaged.

LET OUR MUTUAL ZEAL PROVOKE VERY MANY!

If a whole State or district or a fairly large division of a State is engaged ina  systematic enterprise at the same time, the leadership may well be vested in a committee or board with an executive secretary.  It would be particularly advantageous if the forces of the young people of the Church and of any missionary organizations within the Church could operate under the officers of the Church.  In some sections of our Church this spirit is even now in evidence, the officers of the various bodies recognizing the possibilities of utilizing the energy of the young people and the latter offering their services to be directed according to the best interests of the Church.

Much labor may be probably saved if such a plan is executed by checking off various mission-fields in advance.  In one of the Districts of our Church the following question sheet has been prepared in making ready for a systemic canvass.

f this information, or a large part of it, is available in smaller towns or in rural communities, it will serve very well to prepare the ground for a systematic canvass, for it affords centers from which our work can radiate in all directions.

But whether such specific preparation went ahead or not, the work in every congregation or in every circle of congregations uniting and cooperating in this work ought to be organized.

The first step is to GAIN AND ORGANIZE the workers.  We are assuming, as a matter of course, that all the members of every congregation will take an interest, and, if possible, an ACTIVE INTEREST, in every form of missionary endeavor.  But there is always a large number which cannot be counted upon for actual participation.  Many of the older people no longer have the physical strength demanded by a strenuous campaign.  Others are often absent from the city or have work of a kind which makes it impossible for them to take part.  It is to be hoped, and that most devoutly, that the number of actual shirkers in an enterprise of this importance will be very small.

The cooperation of all church-members may be solicited in enlisting them with the young people whose ministry is here particularly presupposed.  The pastor may address the organizations concerned with a direct appeal to cooperate.  Even a special sermon setting forth the need of personal work would be highly acceptable.

_Arrange for a meeting_ of all those who are interested in the systematic mission endeavor, even for those who cannot take an active part, but are willing to lend their moral and, possibly, their financial support.  Open the meeting with a devotional service, which emphasizes the need of consecration and of personal work.  Explain the object of the meeting as clearly as possible, with reference to the Lord's commission, the obligation of love, the world's need of the Gospel, the possibility of soul-winning, the importance of trained workers, and all the other points which are needed to bring home to every one present the paramount importance of the enterprise.  Let the undertaking be discussed from the floor of the meeting.  If you have not arranged for the appointment of an executive committee beforehand (which is sometimes advisable), let it be done in this meeting.  Have the assembly perfect a permanent organization, with a minimum of rules and by-laws.  Try to get as many pledges of WORKERS as possible.

Emphasize the need of training.  _Arrange meetings for information and drill_.  In these meetings the informational side must be stressed most strongly; for it is knowledge on the part of the canvassers that will count, even if they are never expressly called upon to make a statement of their belief.  In the pamphlet _Send Me!_ there are eight outlines of study, which may form the basis for systematic training.  But the class may also take up the first chapters of this present book and go over them very carefully, especially with a view of becoming acquainted with the Scriptural background.  The Word of God is full of divine energy and power, and an intensive study of any series of passages will invariably bring blessings which enable us to understand more fully the surpassing riches of God's grace and mercy.

At the same time the _devotional element_ must not be lacking in these lessons.  Unless we always remain conscious of the immense responsibility laid on us by the OBLIGATION OF LOVE, our work for Christ tends to become mechanical and lifeless.  The fire of our own soul will most easily kindle fire in the souls of others, while a mechanical repetition of Bible-passages may cause little response.  Let every one attending the meetings realize the seriousness of the situation and the responsibility resting upon every one who takes part in this work.

The _practical side of canvassing_ must be both STRESSED and DRILLED.  A great many people are diffident when meeting strangers; they appear shy and self-conscious.  We must try to overcome this feeling for the sake of successful canvassing.  If we present ourselves at the door of a strange house with an air which is either too apologetic or too bold, we may spoil our approach at once.  For that reason it is well that the lessons stress points of such interest to the workers.  Let those who have had successful experience in canvassing explain the manner in which they made their calls and just how they avoided being drawn into arguments without missing the chance to testify for the truth.  The last meetings especially should be devoted to practical demonstrations, with the imaginary situation approaching as nearly to real life as circumstances will permit.  At this time the teams of two will have been selected, and the committee in charge, under the direction of the pastor, can easily arrange a setting which will be like that actually found when the workers make their rounds.

It is self-evident that _literature which is used in the systematic mission endeavor_ must be understood by all those who take part in the work.  Samples of canvassers' cards should be in the hands of all members as their use is explained.  Let these cards be used in the practical demonstrations, so that the teams will know exactly what to do when they come to a door.  Emphasize the fact that _every space_ should be utilized if possible.  The canvassers must also understand the advertising literature of their own congregation, such as cards stating the location of the church, time of worship, pulpit programs, a letter of personal invitation from the pastor stating the outstanding features of Lutheranism, etc.  These cards or letters may be left at every house of unchurched and of people coming under this heading as a matter of routine.  _Literature is not distributed to such as profess membership in any Christian denomination, unless such people ask for this information_.  

Meanwhile the pastor (or pastors) and the committee (or committees) will prepare for the actual canvass by _laying out_ the field according to its geographical boundaries, so that each group working in the endeavor may have a definite district.  This is essential especially where parish boundaries are no longer observed.  Under no circumstances may we become busybodies in other men's matters in carrying out our systematic mission endeavor, nor may we interfere with the work of any Christian congregation.  If we find people who are already members of one or of our own congregations or of any other Christian congregation, it is self-evident that we do not include these in our endeavor; we simply note down the facts as given us (name, address, church connection), thank the people for the information given, and then go about our business.  It has been found that an actual map of the districts canvassed, drawn as nearly as possible to scale, will greatly stimulate the interest of the workers and of other members of the congregation.  If a member of the committee who has some training in statistical work will indicate, in the course of the campaign, the homes of all people visited, using tacks of a different color for such as are members of the local church, such as are members of other churches, such as are unchurched and seem to be definite prospects, and such as are unchurched and show no interest, at present, in the message of the Gospel, the map will serve for visual instruction and very likely stimulate to further efforts.

It may prove of great value to _obtain_ at this time, through a committee especially elected or appointed for this purpose, _a list of all those_ who, for any reason whatever, _have drifted away from the Lutheran Church_.  Let this committee be known as the Tracing Committee.  In order to accomplish something for the success of the campaign, this committee will consult all available records (under the direction of the pastor), comparing those of years ago with the present church records.  Records of baptisms, confirmations, marriages, even of deaths, ought to be consulted, also the lists of those who have removed from the parish, probably leaving behind them some relatives or friends.  If the former address of such people is available, inquiry, if necessary at the offices of moving companies, may bring information concerning the new address.  All the names gained by this search are placed in the list of the districts as outlined according to geographical boundaries in order that special efforts may be concentrated upon gaining these people once more.  If they have moved to remote parts of the city or to another State, the pastor living nearest their present location ought to be notified.  If they are still in the district served by the congregation, they will be given special attentino in the canvass and later in the follow-up work.

Let us not forget, throughout, that our interest is not confined to former Lutherans or to people of German or Scandinavian descent, of whom we may often assume that they may feel some interest in the Lutheran Church on account of former associations.  Our systematic mission endeavor has in mind the winning of as many of the unchurched as possible, regardless of race, color, and nationality.  We shall, therefore, pay just as much attention to this phase of our endeavors as to any other.

After all preliminary and preparatory work has been done in a proper manner, so that all concerned in the endeavor have a clear conception of the extent and character of their participation and _know exactly what they are to do_, the missionary CANVASS itself may be undertaken.

BE SURE TO HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIES ON HAND!  These include, in addition to the local advertising matter, _canvassers' cards, tracts_ covering topics which will probably be broached (for there is no time for arguments during a canvass), and cards for tabulating results.  Envelopes showing the name and address of the church are almost indispensable.  The working room of the Executive Committee ought to have cards of a regulation size, preferably 5x3, in four colors, for tabulating the results of the canvass.  The last-named workshould be in charge of a Typing Committee, which can immediately transfer the records from the canvassers' cards to the working records for follow-up work.

The canvass itself may, in preparatory fashion, be conducted _by mail_, this work being in the hands of a Mailing Committee.  The object of this undertaking is to address all those prospects who, according to the information gathered, have fallen away, in an inspiring letter, inviting them to the special service at the church, where a sermon suited to the occasion will be preached and other features may be introduced which will make this service stand out from others.  If this service is followed by a social meeting in the parish hall, which is conducted in a cheerful spirit and yet in thorough harmony with the serious purpose in view, it may be productive of much good in bringing in such as are still strangers or such as have fallen away from the Church and its ministrations.

The organization for the canvass will, at this time, have about the following form: --

```
COME BACK TO THIS AND MAKE THE CHART
```

Let us now take up the PERSONAL CANVASS itself, especially for supplying such information as may not as yet have been given.  As stated above, much attention is given, in the last training-lessons, to practical drill int he manner of approaching people and getting results.  When everybody is letter-perfect and the enthusiasm is of the right kind, the canvass proper may be held, either on a stated Sunday afternoon or within a given time, which must be exactly fixed beforehand.  Before going out on their routes as assigned to them by the Executive Committee, the workerswill assemble for some ten or fifteen minutes to join in a short devotional service by the pastor.  Equipped with all the supplies needed, the canvassers will then go out on their rounds.  

One member of each team of two takes care of the cards, while the other does the talking and takes the lead in any short conversation at the door.  The address of the place will be noted down before the door-bell is rung.  As soon as some one appears at the door, the spokesman will say: --

"Good afternoon [or whatever time of day it may be].  Pardon me, we are no salesmen [or saleswomen], but we are taking a religious census in the neighborhood.  You surely will be ready to give us a little information?"  Then follow the questions for the name, church-membership or preference, if any; children from two years up, any Sunday-school affiliation, language, or whatever else may be desirable.  If people declare that they are members of some church, we stop right there, for in that case the other information does not concern us.  It must be definitely understood that people belonging to any other Lutheran congregation or to any other Christian denomination besides our own will not be urged to come to our churches, only the unchurched and those outside the pale of Christianity being invited.  An exception holds good only in case of such people as come to us of their own free will, being anxious to find out what the Lutheran Church teaches.  Be sure to express your thanks for the information before leaving the door.

Among the practical suggestions to canvassers the following from Gallmann, _A Manual for Welfare Workers_, are valuable: --
