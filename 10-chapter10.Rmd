# I Will Seek That Which was Lost.  Ezek. 34, 16.
## Canvassing. {-}

We have now come to the point where the practical execution of the plan is the primary consideration.  It is understood, of course, that the Lutheran soul-winner does not confine his efforts to any one day in the year, that he is not satisfied with one particular occasion for doing the greatest good.  Our aim is to do good to all men, to try to interest them in their soul's salvation at all times, to keep the possibilities of the message of redemption in view whenever occasion offers

At the same time, experience has shown that great, united, systematic mission endeavors are productive of much good.  It is self-evident, in the case of Lutherans, that the emotional element must not become too prominent.  Informatino concerning mission-work, concerning the will of God pertaining to our sanctification, a thorough knowledge of the needs of men and of the way to help them in their spiritual need is essential to our work.  Emotionalism alone is like a straw-fire, which quickly burns out and therefore is without lasting effects.  The fire which we aim to kindle by our missionary endeavors is intended to set fire to heart and conscience, to mind and soul, for we want men to accept the message of the recemption of their souls through the atonement wrought by Christ.
