# I Will Seek That Which was Lost.  Ezek. 34, 16.
## Canvassing. {-}

We have now come to the point where the practical execution of the plan is the primary consideration.  It is understood, of course, that the Lutheran soul-winner does not confine his efforts to any one day in the year, that he is not satisfied with one particular occasion for doing the greatest good.  Our aim is to do good to all men, to try to interest them in their soul's salvation at all times, to keep the possibilities of the message of redemption in view whenever occasion offers

At the same time, experience has shown that great, united, systematic mission endeavors are productive of much good.  It is self-evident, in the case of Lutherans, that the emotional element must not become too prominent.  Informatino concerning mission-work, concerning the will of God pertaining to our sanctification, a thorough knowledge of the needs of men and of the way to help them in their spiritual need is essential to our work.  Emotionalism alone is like a straw-fire, which quickly burns out and therefore is without lasting effects.  The fire which we aim to kindle by our missionary endeavors is intended to set fire to heart and conscience, to mind and soul, for we want men to accept the message of the recemption of their souls through the atonement wrought by Christ.

"I will make My words in thy mouth fire."  Jer. 5, 14.

"Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart."  Jer. 15, 16.

"O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord!"  Jer. 22, 29.

"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread or thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord."  Amos 8, 11.

"The Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."  Heb. 4, 12.

The fundamental idea, the thought underlying the whole project and giving it the proper motivation, is that indicated by the love of the Messiah.

"I WILL SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST!"  Ezek. 34, 16.

That was the definite intention, the consecrated determination, of the promised Messiah, of the Christ of God, hundreds of years before He appeared in the flesh.  It was not due to any fault on His part that men were lost.  Every member of mankind had but himself to blame for losing his way and being in danger of damnation.  All we like sheep have gone astray. -- But the Savior declared that He would SEEK that which was lost.  Without any merit or worthiness of the part of those who were concerned in His counsel of love He yet decided to make the sacrifice, to offer up Himself for the salvation of the human race.

LET THIS MIND BE ALSO IN US!  With this love of Christ stirring our hearts into a flame, with the full knowledge of the great issues involved, we must, in our canvassing, SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST.  Let that object stand out before our eyes at all times, and we shall not waver in our purpose.

The suggestion is to set our great endeavor in motion with a concerted effort and with the consciousness that hundreds and thousands of our fellow-Christians throughout the Church are similarly engaged.

LET OUR MUTUAL ZEAL PROVOKE VERY MANY!

If a whole State or district or a fairly large division of a State is engaged ina  systematic enterprise at the same time, the leadership may well be vested in a committee or board with an executive secretary.  It would be particularly advantageous if the forces of the young people of the Church and of any missionary organizations within the Church could operate under the officers of the Church.  In some sections of our Church this spirit is even now in evidence, the officers of the various bodies recognizing the possibilities of utilizing the energy of the young people and the latter offering their services to be directed according to the best interests of the Church.

Much labor may be probably saved if such a plan is executed by checking off various mission-fields in advance.  In one of the Districts of our Church the following question sheet has been prepared in making ready for a systemic canvass.

f this information, or a large part of it, is available in smaller towns or in rural communities, it will serve very well to prepare the ground for a systematic canvass, for it affords centers from which our work can radiate in all directions.

But whether such specific preparation went ahead or not, the work in every congregation or in every circle of congregations uniting and cooperating in this work ought to be organized.

The first step is to GAIN AND ORGANIZE the workers.  We are assuming, as a matter of course, that all the members of every congregation will take an interest, and, if possible, an ACTIVE INTEREST, in every form of missionary endeavor.  But there is always a large number which cannot be counted upon for actual participation.  Many of the older people no longer have the physical strength demanded by a strenuous campaign.  Others are often absent from the city or have work of a kind which makes it impossible for them to take part.  It is to be hoped, and that most devoutly, that the number of actual shirkers in an enterprise of this importance will be very small.

The cooperation of all church-members may be solicited in enlisting them with the young people whose ministry is here particularly presupposed.  The pastor may address the organizations concerned with a direct appeal to cooperate.  Even a special sermon setting forth the need of personal work would be highly acceptable.

_Arrange for a meeting_ of all those who are interested in the systematic mission endeavor, even for those who cannot take an active part, but are willing to lend their moral and, possibly, their financial support.  Open the meeting with a devotional service, which emphasizes the need of consecration and of personal work.  Explain the object of the meeting as clearly as possible, with reference to the Lord's commission, the obligation of love, the world's need of the Gospel, the possibility of soul-winning, the importance of trained workers, and all the other points which are needed to bring home to every one present the paramount importance of the enterprise.  Let the undertaking be discussed from the floor of the meeting.  If you have not arranged for the appointment of an executive committee beforehand (which is sometimes advisable), let it be done in this meeting.  Have the assembly perfect a permanent organization, with a minimum of rules and by-laws.  Try to get as many pledges of WORKERS as possible.

Emphasize the need of training.  _Arrange meetings for information and drill_.  In these meetings the informational side must be stressed most strongly; for it is knowledge on the part of the canvassers that will count, even if they are never expressly called upon to make a statement of their belief.  In the pamphlet _Send Me!_ there are eight outlines of study, which may form the basis for systematic training.  But the class may also take up the first chapters of this present book and go over them very carefully, especially with a view of becoming acquainted with the Scriptural background.  The Word of God is full of divine energy and power, and an intensive study of any series of passages will invariably bring blessings which enable us to understand more fully the surpassing riches of God's grace and mercy.

At the same time the _devotional element_ must not be lacking in these lessons.  Unless we always remain conscious of the immense responsibility laid on us by the OBLIGATION OF LOVE, our work for Christ tends to become mechanical and lifeless.  The fire of our own soul will most easily kindle fire in the souls of others, while a mechanical repetition of Bible-passages may cause little response.  Let every one attending the meetings realize the seriuosness of the situation and the responsibility resting upon every one who takes part in this work.
