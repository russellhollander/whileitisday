# I Will Seek That Which was Lost.  Ezek. 34, 16.
## Canvassing. {-}

We have now come to the point where the practical execution of the plan is the primary consideration.  It is understood, of course, that the Lutheran soul-winner does not confine his efforts to any one day in the year, that he is not satisfied with one particular occasion for doing the greatest good.  Our aim is to do good to all men, to try to interest them in their soul's salvation at all times, to keep the possibilities of the message of redemption in view whenever occasion offers

At the same time, experience has shown that great, united, systematic mission endeavors are productive of much good.  It is self-evident, in the case of Lutherans, that the emotional element must not become too prominent.  Informatino concerning mission-work, concerning the will of God pertaining to our sanctification, a thorough knowledge of the needs of men and of the way to help them in their spiritual need is essential to our work.  Emotionalism alone is like a straw-fire, which quickly burns out and therefore is without lasting effects.  The fire which we aim to kindle by our missionary endeavors is intended to set fire to heart and conscience, to mind and soul, for we want men to accept the message of the recemption of their souls through the atonement wrought by Christ.

"I will make My words in thy mouth fire."  Jer. 5, 14.

"Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart."  Jer. 15, 16.

"O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord!"  Jer. 22, 29.

"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread or thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord."  Amos 8, 11.

"The Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."  Heb. 4, 12.

The fundamental idea, the thought underlying the whole project and giving it the proper motivation, is that indicated by the love of the Messiah.

"I WILL SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST!"  Ezek. 34, 16.

That was the definite intention, the consecrated determination, of the promised Messiah, of the Christ of God, hundreds of years before He appeared in the flesh.  It was not due to any fault on His part that men were lost.  Every member of mankind had but himself to blame for losing his way and being in danger of damnation.  All we like sheep have gone astray. -- But the Savior declared that He would SEEK that which was lost.  Without any merit or worthiness of the part of those who were concerned in His counsel of love He yet decided to make the sacrifice, to offer up Himself for the salvation of the human race.

LET THIS MIND BE ALSO IN US!  With this love of Christ stirring our hearts into a flame, with the full knowledge of the great issues involved, we must, in our canvassing, SEEK THAT WHICH WAS LOST.  Let that object stand out before our eyes at all times, and we shall not waver in our purpose.

The suggestion is to set our great endeavor in motion with a concerted effort and with the consciousness that hundreds and thousands of our fellow-Christians throughout the Church are similarly engaged.

LET OUR MUTUAL ZEAL PROVOKE VERY MANY!

If a whole State or district or a fairly large division of a State is engaged ina  systematic enterprise at the same time, the leadership may well be vested in a committee or board with an executive secretary.  It would be particularly advantageous if the forces of the young people of the Church and of any missionary organizations within the Church could operate under the officers of the Church.  In some sections of our Church this spirit is even now in evidence, the officers of the various bodies recognizing the possibilities of utilizing the energy of the young people and the latter offering their services to be directed according to the best interests of the Church.

Much labor may be probably saved if such a plan is executed by checking off various mission-fields in advance.  In one of the Districts of our Church the following question sheet has been prepared in making ready for a systemic canvass.
