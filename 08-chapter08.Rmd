BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT.  OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION HAS NO CHURCH AFFILIATION!

Read that sentence again, for we shall consider it once more in connection with the object of the present chapter.  It is a fact which, somehow, must sink into our consciousness by degrees.  It means that an average of six or seven out of every ten persons whom we see on the street, whom we meet on our travels, whith whom we deal in a business way, ARE NOT EVEN NOMINALLY CHRISTIANS!
