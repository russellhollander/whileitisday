# By All Means Save Some!  1 Cor, 9, 22.
## Meeting the Unchurched. {-}

BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT.  OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION HAS NO CHURCH AFFILIATION!

Read that sentence again, for we shall consider it once more in connection with the object of the present chapter.  It is a fact which, somehow, must sink into our consciousness by degrees.  It means that an average of six or seven out of every ten persons whom we see on the street, whom we meet on our travels, whith whom we deal in a business way, ARE NOT EVEN NOMINALLY CHRISTIANS!

This consciousness is bound to work in us the attitude of St. Paul when he wrote, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, the significant words: --

"I am made all things to all men that I mibhg BY ALL MEANS SAVE SOME!"  1 Cor. 9, 22.

The connection in which we find these words is characteristic of the apostle.  We find him, in teh first place, asserting with all vehemence his freedom.  No apostle has emphasized this factor more strongly, as when he calls out to the Galatians: --

"Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage!"  Gal. 5, 1.

If any one was foolish enough to believe his good works were sufficient to earn anything for him in the sight of God, Paul was invariably the first one to disillusion him.

And yet, by a strange apparent paradox, Paul writes: --

"Though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all THAT I MIGHT GAIN THE MORE!"  1 Cor. 9, 19.

It is the wonderful truth which Luther also emphasized when he said a Christian is "free from all and no man's servant, but that he is, at the same time, subject to all and every man's servant."

In the field of justification there is only one fact that stands out, namely, the unmerited grace of God in Christ Jesus, our Savior.  In the domain of sanctification the highest ideal is that set forth by Christ:  "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant."  Matt. 20, 26. 27.

This was the guiding principle of Paul's life, as he briefly shows in describing his manner of work.  To the Jews he became a Jew in order to win the Jews.  Without denying or setting aside one word of the eternal Truth, he accommodated his methods to the circumstances in which he found himself, always with the intention of winning souls for Christ.  He did this in the case of Timothy, Acts 16, 3, in that of the Jews at Jerusalem, since some of the weaker Christians in that city were becoming suspiciuos of his work, Acts 21, 23ff., and in other instances.  Wherever Paul found taht he could yield to weakness and to present lack of information without sacrificing the eternal Truth, he was very ready so to do.

To those under the Law, whether they belonged to the Jewish nation or to the Gentiles (mainly circumcised Gentiles), he became as one under the Law in order to gain those under the Law.  He was willing to conform to the customs, modes of life, and methods of instruction in vogue among them as long as these matters were really things indifferent.  At the same time he never denied the truth or acted in a two-faced manner.

To those without the Law, that is, to the heathen in the strict sense of the word, he became as without the Law, although, as he says, for his own person he was bound under the Law of Christ and was ever eager to do His will in order to gain those without the Law.  When in a heathen community, Paul did not practice the Jewish customs in which he had been trained, for this would merely have antagonized the Gentiles; he omitted all reference to regulations of the Old Testament which were strictly Jewish in character.

To the weak the apostle became weak in order to gain the weak.  His loving insight and gentle tact enabled him to understand the scruples and weaknesses of those who had not as yet made much headway in Christian knowledge.  If the fundamental principles of redemption were not subverted, Paul was ready to exercise patience and kindness to the highest degree.  And all this he did because the love of Christ was the motive for all his actions.  He was possessed of a life of the spirit implanted in his Savior and anxious to demonstrate itself in the service of his fellow-men everywhere.

We, as WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD, must learn from Paul, the great missionary, not to despise any one nor to permit disgust over foolish weaknesses and over lack of spiritual information and knowledge to enter our hearts.  It is a wonderful summary which we find here: --

"TO ALL MEN I HAVE BECOME ALL THINGS IN ORDER BY ALL MEANS TO SAVE SOME!"

This is the spirit that appears in the history of missions, especially in that of the early Church.  It explains the consecration with which men and women bore witness to the Gospel of Christ.  Their attitude is well exemplified in the case of Peter and john and their challenging statement: --

"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  For WE CANNOT BUT SPEAK THE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN AND HEARD."  Acts 4, 19. 20.

This spirit explains also the humility which we find in the early workers, with St. Paul at their head, who exclaimed in a passionate outburst: -- 

"Unto me, who AM LESS THAN THE LEAST OF ALL SAINTS, is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."  Eph. 3, 8.

Now let us return to the first statement of the present chapter.  Let us try to realize the fact that

\begin{center} BETWEEN SIXTY AND SIXTY-FIVE PER CENT. OF OUR ENTIRE POPULATION \end{center}

is not even nominally Christian.  This means, according to the Religious Census of the United States, that so many people in our country do not profess to be members of any so-called Christian church-body, neither Protestant (in the widest sense of the term) nor Catholic.  It means that they ahve no connection with any Church of any type, except, perhaps, that their children occasionally attend some Sunday-school.

It seems almost unbelievable that this should be so, that the many thousands and even millions of our fellow-men and fellow-citizens should declare that they are not personally interested in the Christian religion in even its broadest aspect; but the figures are available for the entire United States, also in the annual figures furnished by Dr. Carroll.  It has been stated that between fifteen and twenty million children in our country are without any instruction in the truths of Christianity.

What is most surprising in the situation, perhaps, is this, that figures coming from rural and semirural districts are not materially different in their totals from those of the larger cities.  Many a small city, even many a town, shows the same proportion of unchurched as the large cities.  It seems strange that hundreds and thousands of people can daily hear church-bells, see church-spires, pass by churches which extend their invitations in various ways, and yet never make a move to investigate the claims of the Church as being an institution for soul-winning.

Now, it has been said by some church-members that people in this country who are born, grow up, live, and die almost within the shadow of a church-steeple have only themselves to blame if they are lost.  This is true enough from God's standpoint.  He expects all men, even on the basis of the slight remnant of the natural knowledge of God (Rom. 1, 18ff.) to "seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him."  Acts 17, 27.

But this is God's privilege, God's perogative.  It does not excuse us from doing the work laid upon us by the DIVINE COMMISSION when the Lord tells us:  "GO YE!"

The UNCHURCHED PEOPLE of America, of any country, are a CONSTANT CHALLENGE TO ALL TRUE BELIEVERS!  We simply MUST go out and meet them!

We must meet the OUT-AND-OUT HOSTILE.  We must remember, in all our work for the Lord, that "the carnal mind is enmity against God," Rom. 8, 7, that is, all men by nature are in a state of enmity, or hostility, against the Gospel.  No man can by his own reason and strength be interested in the Gospel as the message of salvation.  But to this natural aversion against the doctrine of full and free redemption is often added a positive hostility, which aims at the direct destruction of the Gospel news and of its witnesses.

We meet people of this type even without special effort on our part, and we shall certainly meet many more if we engage more generally in specific mission endeavors.  Have you ever tried to sound people with whom you are associated in business, with whom you are working together, whom you meet time and again in a social way?  It is so easy, with the modern form of church publicity, to establish a point of contact, either for positive or for negative results.  One has but to exhibit a pulpit program, a Lenten folder, or some other printed material referring to church activity, with the question, "This will probably interest you?" in order to get some sort of reaction.
