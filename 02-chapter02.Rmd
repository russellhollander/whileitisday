# I Delight to Do Thy Will!  Is. 40, 8
## The obligation of Love. {-}

The divine commission is not an arbitrary command; it is not a legal precept issued by God by virtue of His majesty and power.  It is, as a matter of fact, addressed to Christians and would have no meaning for anyone else.  Only he can understand this commission and properly act upon it in whose heart the Holy Ghost has already wrought a knowledge of the salvation brought by Christ and revealed in His Word.  It is a heart of this kind that is actuated by the obligation of love resting upon it.

And how can it be otherwise, since the Christina continually has before his eyes the wonderful picture of Christ and the manner in which He carried out and satisfied the obligation of love resting upon Him by virtue of His own choice?

For what was the guiding principle of His life and work?

"THEN SAID I, LO, I COME; IN THE VOLUME OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME.  I DELIGHT TO DO THY WILL, O MY GOD."  Ps. 40, 8.

These are words of the Messiah, as the writer to the Hebrews, chap. 10, 5-7, shows.  The Son of God had from eternity taken part in the counsel of God pertaining to fallen mankind, and He had declared His willingness to work the redemption, which none but He could accomplish.  This attitude is evident throughout our Savior's life.

"Wist ye not that I _must_ be about My Father's business?" was the half-reproachful question which He addressed to His parents when He was taken to the festival of the Passover at the age of twelve years.  Luke 2, 49.

"I _must_ walk to-day and to-morrow and the day following."  Luke 13, 33.

"I _must_ work the works of Him that sent Me while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work."  John 9, 4.

"From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He _must_ go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day."  Matt. 16, 21.

"For I say unto you that this that is written _must_ yet be accomplished in Me, And He was reckoned among the transgressors."  Luke 22, 37.

"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give Me more than twleve legions of angels?  But how then shall Scriptures be fulfilled that it _must_ be?"  Matt. 26, 53-54.

"Remember how He spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of Man _must_ be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again."  Luke 24, 7.

"_Ought_ not Christ to havve suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"  Luke 24, 26.

"And He said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus _it behooved Christ_ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day."  Luke 24, 46.

Thus we find it all the way through the life of Christ, -- the "must" of the divine obligation resting upon Him.  He has placed Himself at the disposal of God, and in line with His own eternal will, which is at all times in perfect agreement with that of the Father, John 5, 19, He carried out the plan of redemption.

What the German hymn-writer Paul Gerhardt has the Savior say is true: --

```
Yea, Father, yea most willingly
I'll bear what Thou commandest;
My will conforms to Thy decree,
I do what Thou demandest.--
O wondrous Love, what has Thou done!
The Father offers up his Son,
The Son, content, descendeth!
O Love, O Love, how strong art Thou!
In shroud and grave Thou lay'st Him low
Whose word the mountains rendeth!
```

Where would we and all mankind be if the Savior had wavered in His divine determination, if He had faltered and shrunk at sight of the cross on which His tortured body was to be suspended?!  What an immeasurable burden of gratitude is laid upon us by virtue of His unflinching persistence in the obedience prompted by His redemptive love!

Are you looking for still further evidence regarding the position which soul-winning has in the mind of Christ, the one and only Savior of mankind?  Consider the place it has in His life and work.  Remember that His very name indicates the purpose of His life and work; for Jesus means "Redeemer, Savior."  Matt. 1, 21.

It is the name given to our Lord throughout the New Testament; it is used by the inspired writers with an evident feeling of exultation.  The very angel of the Lord speaks it with a hushed reverence when he announces the birth of the Lord: --

"Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord."  Luke 2, 11.

It is found in the joyful testimony of the Samaritans of Sychar: --

"Now we believe, not because of thy saving; for we have heard Him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."  John 4, 42.

And think of the numerous other passages in which the name is blazoned as on a banner to be borne before the eyes of the believers, to make them realize ever more fully the unspeakable gift of God!  Read them for yourself:  Acts 5, 31; 13, 23; Phil. 3, 20; 2 Tim. 1, 10; Titus 1, 4; 2, 13; 3, 6; 2 Pet. 1, 11; 2, 20; 3, 2. 18; 1 John 4, 14.  

What the name of Jesus indicates, what the angel's explanation proclaims, that is emphasized in Christ's earthly mission.  No one has said it better, no one could express it more definitely than the Lord Himself when He says: --

"The Son of Man is come to save that which was lost."  Matt. 18, 11.  And again: --

"The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."  Luke 19, 10.

This is also the clear statement of that "Gospel in a nutshell," given in Christ's own words: --

"God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  John 3, 16.

"These things I say that ye might be saved."  John 5, 34.  

"I am the Door; by Me, if any man enter in, He shall be saved."  John 10, 9.

"This is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on Him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day."  John 6, 40.

In the very performance of His miracles our Lord's chief gift was that of the forgiveness of sins with its assurance of salvation.  To the man sick of the palsy He gave, first of all, that wonderful certainty: --

"Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee."  Matt. 9, 2; Luke 5, 20.

And when the great sinner knelt at His feet in the house of the Pharisee, the most outstanding gift of Christ is that which He Himself indicates: --

"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven."  Luke 7, 47.

That this winning of souls for the kingdom of God was the object of Christ in all His preaching, in all His work, is obvious from the general tone and tendency of all His acts and all of His precepts.  He tells the former demoniac to preach the kingdom of God.  He summarizes His own invitation in the words:  "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes, highways and hedges, and compel them to come in."  As Dr. Pierson says:  "The command is one which is incarnated in His whole life and is suggested or implied in the very idea of discipleship:  'Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.'"
