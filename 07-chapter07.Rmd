# I Am Persuaded.  Rom. 8, 38
## Having the Courage of One's Convictions. {-}

The discussion of the present chapter is essential for the purpose of this study.  It speaks of a most important part of the personal equipment of the worker for Christ.  Without the qualification which it imples much of the testifying for Chirist is of an indifferent, mechanical kind, without the force that, in itself, carries the certainty of conviction.

Luther was wont to refer to a man who was not at all times ready to stand up for his convictions as a "soft-stepper."  He did not mean to question the sincerity of any one, but he felt that some of the fundamental principles of the truth were occasionally sacrificed on the altar of what men would like to describe as tact, but which often has its roots in a timidity not at all in keeping with the high ideals held out by the Word of God.
